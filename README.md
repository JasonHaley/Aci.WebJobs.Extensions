# Aci.WebJobs.Extensions
Azure WebJob and Function extension to work with Azure Container Instance.

Still in the early stages.

It uses the latest nightly build of Microsoft.Azure.WebJob.Extenstions and requires a Service Principal in order to work with the ContainerInstance Management APIs.

Goal is a set of utilities to allow Functions and WebJobs to create, interact and delete containers in ACI.
